# YouBike Demand Prediction & Optimization

## Project Overview

This project studies short-term YouBike station demand using historical usage
data, weather information, and time-based features. The long-term goal is to
combine demand forecasting with a bike redistribution strategy.

## Objectives

- Explore spatial and temporal YouBike usage patterns.
- Build reproducible data-cleaning and feature-engineering pipelines.
- Train and compare baseline machine-learning models for demand prediction.
- Evaluate models with appropriate forecasting metrics.
- Explore redistribution optimization after a reliable forecasting baseline is
  available.

## Planned Workflow

1. Collect and document official YouBike and weather data.
2. Inspect data quality, missing values, and station coverage.
3. Clean and transform the raw data.
4. Create time, weather, and station-level features.
5. Establish a simple baseline model.
6. Train and compare machine-learning models.
7. Evaluate errors by station and time period.
8. Use validated forecasts to explore redistribution optimization.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Requests

Additional libraries will be added only when the project reaches the stage that
requires them.

dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

## Project Status

🚧 **In development**

The repository currently contains the initial project structure only. Data
collection, notebooks, models, optimization, and evaluation results have not
been completed yet.
